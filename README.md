# Buncard

A simple app that helps store your loyalty cards, membership cards, and other barcodes all in one place.

## About

Buncard lets you keep all your cards in one convenient location. The app stores all data locally on your device - there are no servers or accounts required. Your data remains private and can be easily exported or imported. This is a public open-source repository, so contributions or suggestions are encouraged.
